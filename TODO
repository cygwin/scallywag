## TODO

- Do not build in subdir of scallywag checkout, to avoid 'git describe' potentially finding a scallywag .git dir
- use a venv to avoid depending on user installation of required python modules
- don't be terrible

- fetcher should check if pending jobs have completed, in case we've missed a job conclusion status notification
