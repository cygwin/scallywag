## TODO

- Do not build in subdir of scallywag checkout, to avoid 'git describe' potentially finding a scallywag .git dir
- pass src pkg as an artifact to binary pkg jobs rather than using checkout
- use a venv to avoid depending on user installation of required python modules
- don't be terrible

- authenticated ways for maintainers to interact with scallywag (via 'ssh cygwin@cygwin.com jobs <subcommand>' ?)
-- cancel a job
-- retry a job
-- deploy a successful job that run without deploy token
